# SiteGenX
The small html website generator powered with CF.

This project is used to quickly put together a website once it is designed. The index and interior sample pages are separated into sections and entered into the site generator admin.

Once they are in the system, they can be edited through the admin if needed. 

The site does not use a database, but uses json files to hold the data. Since ColdFusion is not needed after the generation, any hosting platform can use the static site.
